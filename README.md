#t.co bypass for greasemonkey & chrome

fairly self explanatory, but just in case, this package will replace t.co urls on twitter and tweetdeck by using other attributes in the anchor tag.

##chrome

- navigate to the __extensions__ screen
- ensure that __developer mode__ is checked
- select __load unpacked extensions__
- navigate to wherever you cloned this repo
- click __ok__
- enjoy no more t.co redirects

##firefox

- install greasemonkey
- add __greasemonkey.js__ to your userscripts

##safari
- install t.co-bypass.safariextz

##ie

- Anyone want to build this?
